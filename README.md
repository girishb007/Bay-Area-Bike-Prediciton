# Cmpe255_final_project

This is the repository for Data Mining Group project. 

All files that we worked on are present in the [/code](/code). folder.

The files for application created for this project is located in [/code/model](/code/model).
The instructions for running the flask application are included in [this](/code/model/readme.txt) file present in [/code/model](/code/model).

# 1.Purposes 

The major objectives of our project were the regression and projections of bike riders at a certain Bay Area city for a specific day using the multiple time, weather, and behavior factors that we have access to. 

In order to anticipate the travel patterns for certain cities using the processed data, we planned to examine the dataset, manipulate and extract the data, pre-process the dataset, and then use regression algorithms and approaches.
